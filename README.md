# my_linux_experience
I have had some experiences with installing Linux OSs for a while. Now I want to try to daily drive it &amp; iron out the kinks.

I am mainly using Fedora 42 as my work & study machine, Rocky Linux Stream as my server to learn, and CachyOS for playing games.

In `jounals` you can find various issues I have experienced and dealt with. Specifically with Fedora 42.

11/18/25 Update: I have moved my Laptop back to Windows 11. The support for desktop linux was not very good. I will also benefit from having a Windows machine as I use Azure at work. I will continue to use CachyOS on my desktop.

11/29/25:
- Windows 11 sucks, I am recongifuring my setup:
- Gaming PC --> CachyOS
- Study/Personal Laptop --> MX Linux
- Homelab/Testing Laptop --> Ubuntu 22.4 LTS
- Homelab services latop --> Proxmox
