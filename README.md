# Linux Learning Journey

A practical, hands-on path toward becoming a stronger SysAdmin and DevOps engineer.

## Overview

This repository documents my ongoing journey learning Linux from the perspective of an aspiring systems administrator and DevOps professional. Rather than using Linux casually, I’m focusing on developing real operational skills: installation, configuration, troubleshooting, system maintenance, service management, and working across multiple distributions.

Linux is a core skill in infrastructure and automation, and this project serves as my learning journal, reference notes, and a record of the problems I’ve encountered and how I solved them.

## Current Learning Goals

* Build confidence with daily Linux usage
* Practice system troubleshooting and root-cause analysis
* Understand differences between major distributions
* Strengthen skills in package management, networking, systemd, and shell environments
* Develop habits around documentation, reproducibility, and clean system configuration
* Maintain small lab environments to practice DevOps concepts

## My Linux Setup

To learn Linux more deeply, I use several distributions, each chosen for a specific purpose. This helps me experience the differences between rolling releases, enterprise systems, and stable long-term distributions.

### Desktop and Daily Use

* **CachyOS (Gaming PC)** – An Arch-based system used for gaming and gaining familiarity with the Arch ecosystem
* **MX Linux (Study/Personal Laptop)** – A stable Debian-based environment for coursework, scripting, and everyday use

### Homelab and Server Learning

* **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Testing Laptop)** – Used for service hosting, networking practice, and learning the Ubuntu/Debian package ecosystem
* **Proxmox (Homelab Services Laptop)** – Used to learn virtualization, VM lifecycle management, storage, and general infrastructure concepts

These systems give me space to experiment, break things, fix them, and gain confidence across different Linux environments.

## Journals

The `journals/` directory contains notes on:

* Issues I’ve run into
* How I diagnosed them
* The solutions or workarounds I applied
* What I learned from each situation

Troubleshooting is one of the best ways to build real experience, so documenting it is part of my learning process.
