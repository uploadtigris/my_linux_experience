# my_linux_experience
I have had some experiences with installing Linux OSs for a while. Now I want to try to daily drive it &amp; iron out the kinks.

I am mainly using Fedora 42 as my work & study machine, Cent OS Stream as my server to learn, and CachyOS for gaming and all other silly things.

In `jounals` you can find various issues I have experienced and dealt with. Specifically with Fedora 42.
